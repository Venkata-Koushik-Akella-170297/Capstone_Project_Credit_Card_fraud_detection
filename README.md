This capstone project on Credit card fraud detection for the DSC49-DL track is done by the group of Koushik.A.V, Ankit and Ankit Pandey. This project mainly focuses on the detection of fraudelent credit card transactions. Here we build a model to identify the pattern of fraud transactions by using the data from Kaggle. this is an extensive dataset with nearly 2.8L data points, and is also highly imbalanced in terms of number of fraudelant transactions as compared to genuine transactions
